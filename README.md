# Introduction
### Hello there 👋🏾,

Thanks for stopping by.👍

In this project, I called a dictionary api using dotnet console. [Daneethedeveloper](https://github.com/DaneeTheDeveloper) did an amazing job by adding a Blazor UI to it.
[Here](https://github.com/DaneeTheDeveloper/HTTPClientDemo2-) it is.
As .net changes I'm open to learning new ways of approaching the various concepts implemented in the http client project. 

## How to run the App
1. Clone the app to your machine.
2. CD into the "src" directory and then "DictionaryBackend" directory.
3. Ensure your have dotnet core 3.1 installed. If not download from [here] (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1) .
4. Run the project by typing `dotnet run` and press enter.
5. The project should open in your browser.
